How well does rsync handle TAR files?

Tar files are basically a bunch of files appended together:

```python
[header]
[file1]
[header]
[file2]
...
```

And rsync is supposed to be smart about just transferring the parts of files that
have changed. If I append to a tar file of course it'll be efficient:

```sh
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=100 > /tmp/big1
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1M count=100 > /tmp/big2
tar -rvf a.tar /tmp/big1
rsync -v a.tar localhost:/tmp/out.tar

→ sent 104,893,539 bytes  received 35 bytes  209,787,148.00 bytes/sec
→ total size is 104,867,840  speedup is 1.00

tar -rvf a.tar /tmp/big2
rsync -v a.tar localhost:/tmp/out.tar

→ sent 104,934,486 bytes  received 71,726 bytes  42,002,484.80 bytes/sec
→ total size is 209,725,440  speedup is 2.00
```

But what if I add the new file to the beginning?

```sh
/bin/rm /tmp/out.tar
tar -rvf 1.tar /tmp/big1
rsync -v 1.tar localhost:/tmp/out.tar

→ total size is 104,867,840  speedup is 1.00

tar -rvf 2-1.tar /tmp/big2 /tmp/big1
rsync -v 2-1.tar localhost:/tmp/out.tar

→ total size is 209,725,440  speedup is 2.00
```

Looks good. What if I change the order?

```sh
tar -rvf 1-2.tar /tmp/big1 /tmp/big2
rsync -v 1-2.tar localhost:/tmp/out.tar

→ total size is 209,725,440  speedup is 1,130.39
```

Even that is fine. Looks like rsync does a pretty good job of finding existing chunks.
